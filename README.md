# Frontdesk Human-in-the-Loop AI Supervisor

This project is the first version of a Human-in-the-Loop system for AI receptionists.  
If the AI agent doesn't know an answer, it intelligently escalates to a human supervisor, follows up with the customer, and updates its internal knowledge base automatically.
